							<p>Conducted a research project on the existing and upcoming technology for autonomous driving cars. Suggested an assortment combination of technologies which could work in harmony to ensure success of the autonomous vehicles industry. Designed and built a Bluetooth controlled Car. The car had obstacle sensing and braking feature. Various sensors were used in coordination with a centrally placed Arduino Nano Controller chip which controlled the actions to be taken once the limits on the sensor readings were reached.</p>
							<p>Designed an <a href="https://github.com/ojaashampiholi/Accident_Detection_Device">Accident Detection Device</a> based on IoT as Final Year project towards my BE in Electronics and Telecommunication. The Raspberry Pi Processor was at the heart of this project. Various peripherals like ultrasonic sensors, accelerometer, Bluetooth Module, Wifi module, Camera were interfaced to the processor in this project. The testing for accident detetction accuracy was done in lab conditions and improvements were left for the succeding batch of students.</p>
